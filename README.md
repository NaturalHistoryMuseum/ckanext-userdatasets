_A CKAN extension that allows organisation members to create datasets, and edit or delete the datasets they have created._

<!--header-end-->

# Overview

<!--overview-start-->
This extension changes the permissions of users with the 'Member' role in an organisation, allowing them to create
datasets, and to edit or delete the datasets they have created. Unlike users with the 'Editor' role, they cannot
edit or delete datasets created by other users.

Notes:
- This applies to the existing 'Member' role rather than creating a new one as it is currently not possible to add
  new roles from an extension;
- The plugin works with custom dataset types, however it will not work with other plugins which override
  package/resource update/create/delete authorization functions, and package_create/update actions.

**Warning: This plugin modifies CKAN's permission system. The current implementation cannot be considered fully
 safe and should only be used AT YOUR OWN RISK in a trusted environment. Ensure you run the tests with your plugins
 enabled.**

# Installation

<!--installation-start-->
Path variables used below:
- `$INSTALL_FOLDER` (i.e. where CKAN is installed), e.g. `/usr/lib/ckan/default`
- `$CONFIG_FILE`, e.g. `/etc/ckan/default/development.ini`

## Installing from PyPI

```shell
pip install ckanext-userdatasets
```

## Installing from source

1. Clone the repository into the `src` folder:
   ```shell
   cd $INSTALL_FOLDER/src
   git clone https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/ckanext-userdatasets.git
   ```

2. Activate the virtual env:
   ```shell
   . $INSTALL_FOLDER/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install via pip:
   ```shell
   pip install $INSTALL_FOLDER/src/ckanext-userdatasets
   ```

### Installing in editable mode

Installing from a `pyproject.toml` in editable mode (i.e. `pip install -e`) requires `setuptools>=64`; however, CKAN 2.9 requires `setuptools==44.1.0`. See [our CKAN fork](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/ckan) for a version of v2.9 that uses an updated setuptools if this functionality is something you need.

## Post-install setup

1. Add 'userdatasets' to the list of plugins in your `$CONFIG_FILE`:
   ```ini
   ckan.plugins = ... userdatasets
   ```

# Configuration

<!--configuration-start-->
There are no configuration options for this extension.

<!--configuration-end-->

# Usage

<!--usage-start-->
## Actions

No new actions are defined in this extension; three are overridden to modify validators and permissions.

### `package_create`

### `package_update`

### `organization_list_for_user`

<!--usage-end-->

# Testing

<!--testing-start-->
There is a Docker compose configuration available in this repository to make it easier to run tests. The ckan image uses the Dockerfile in the `docker/` folder.

To run the tests against ckan 2.9.x on Python3:

1. Build the required images:
   ```shell
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Then run the tests.
   The root of the repository is mounted into the ckan container as a volume by the Docker compose
   configuration, so you should only need to rebuild the ckan image if you change the extension's
   dependencies.
   ```shell
   docker-compose run ckan
   ```
